# number-guess

Some people would call this a number guessing game, Apple would call it revolutionary if they invented it themselves.
I call it my first attempt at a 'game' in Clojure. Please be nice, it's my first time! :-)

(Oh yes, there's no tests, I'm learning!)


## Usage

    $ java -jar number-guess-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
